# A Comparison of string-matching algorithms

The purpose of this paper is to explore the string-matching problem. The problem is to find occurrences of a pattern in a given text.

In this paper, we compare 5 string-matching algorithms:

- Brute Force,
- Sunday,
- Rabin Karp,
- Finite State Machine and
- Knuth–Morris–Pratt.
